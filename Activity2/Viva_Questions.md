# Viva Questions – Advanced Lists

1. What is amortized time complexity?

   -> Average time taken per operation over a sequence of operations.

2. Why is ArrayList resizing expensive?

   -> Requires creating a new array and copying all elements.

3. How does LinkedList store elements?

   -> As nodes containing data and reference(s).

4. Singly vs Doubly Linked List?

   -> Singly: one pointer, less memory.
   Doubly: two pointers, faster traversal.

5. Space complexity of LinkedList?

   -> O(n), but higher than ArrayList due to extra pointers.
